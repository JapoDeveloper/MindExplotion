# MindExplotion
My personal version of the legendary Simon Game of Hasbro.

<h2>How to play?</h1>

<p>First the user click the start button then the game play a background music and turn on the first button light of the sequence.</p>

If the user repeat the sequence correctly so the game show the user the last sequence adding one more button light to them.

<h2>Features</h2>

In the main screen the user can click over bottom button in the screen to list its games played. 
<em>See the next screen.</em>
